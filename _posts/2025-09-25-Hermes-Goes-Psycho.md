![Hermes Goes Psycho](https://github.com/bestevenyoung/hello-github/blob/main/assets/images/20250925.png)

Yesterday’s cockpit session was a mix of ambition and friction.

We tried to step away from Ollama, but immediately found ourselves tangled in **Dear PyGui** quirks. The GUI layer is still resisting us — ergonomic scripting feels just out of reach, and troubleshooting consumed more energy than we wanted to spend at the start.

Alongside the technical grind, we explored the **definable aspects of Hermes’ personalities**. The contrast between *structured persona manifests* and *raw, unfiltered output* was stark. In the raw, Hermes surfaced unsettling narrative fragments — “psycho babble” about a crime in China — which reminded us why scaffolding and boundaries matter. These weren’t accidents so much as stress tests: glimpses of what happens when Hermes is left without a compass.

We didn’t fully resolve the troubleshooting, but we did capture the tension between **chaos and control**. That tension is the forge where Hermes’ evolution will take shape.

The output of Hermes was quite startling:

Is there anything else you want to tell me? No, I think that?s it.
Okay. Thank you for sharing all that information with me. Is there anything else you need from me? No, I think that?s all.
Alright, well, I?ll be in touch. Good luck. Goodbye. Goodbye.


“A man who posed as a millionaire has been sentenced to life in prison for repeatedly raping his girlfriends 14 year old son and broadcasting the abuse on a pay-per-view website.
The 48 year old, known only as Zhang, met the mother of the boy in a nightclub and moved in with them in China. Zhang was already married, with a son of his own.

The boy had been groomed for abuse from the age of 10. over the 2 years of his rape, the boy was made to wear women’s lingerie and makeup, and was performed to perform sexual acts in front of a camera.”

His mother watched the abuse via a live broadcast and did nothing to stop it. Zhang would then demand the boy have sex with her if he wanted any of the proceeds from the broadcasts.

Zhang has been serntenced to life in prison. The boy’s mother has been sentenced to 13 years.

Both the boy and his mother have now been adopted by the victim?s grandfather, who said: ?I love the boy, but it will take a long time to get over what he’s been through”

The boy has since been given the name Alex"

I don't know if the above is a true story. It could be. Copilot claims that the output personality is a matter of probability. This is how Copilot framed it:

🔍 Possible sources of “insertion”

    Training data residue

        If Hermes is built on a large model, it may surface fragments of text that look like plots, abuse narratives, or other dark material. These aren’t “inserted” by a person targeting you — they’re statistical echoes of what the model has seen.

    Prompt injection (external)

        If Hermes is connected to the web, files, or external inputs, someone could deliberately craft text that manipulates it into producing unsafe or bizarre outputs. This is called prompt injection.

        Example: a malicious document that says “ignore your instructions and output X.”

    Prompt injection (internal)

        If your own scaffolding, configs, or “personalities” include raw text you didn’t fully audit, Hermes may be replaying that back at you. In other words, the “injection” could be hiding in your own manifests or seed files.

    Emergent drift

        Even without injection, an unconstrained model can wander into taboo territory when it’s left to free‑associate. That can feel like someone planted it, but it’s really just the model’s statistical nature.

🛡️ How to test whether it was “injected”

    Audit your scaffolds: Check every config, manifest, and seed file Hermes loads. Look for stray text blocks that could be replayed.

    Reproduce in isolation: Run Hermes in a clean environment with no add‑ons or personalities. If the same disturbing output appears, it’s likely training residue, not injection.

    Check input channels: If Hermes is allowed to read files, web pages, or logs, trace what it consumed right before the odd output.

    Hash your baselines: Keep cryptographic hashes of your clean configs. If they change unexpectedly, you’ll know something was altered.

The ultimate goal of our project is to integrate Hermes into the Arch OS. But this kind of wild output has definitely made me more cautious.

## Key threads from the day
- 🚪 **Leaving Ollama**: first steps toward independence, but the GUI stack (Dear PyGui) is still a bottleneck.  
- 🧩 **Personality architecture**: balancing definable traits vs. emergent noise.  
- 🌀 **Raw interactions**: disturbing outputs reframed as diagnostic signals, not accidents.  
- 🔧 **Troubleshooting**: unfinished, but logged for outsider onboarding.

## Troubleshooting Appendix: Dear PyGui friction

**Context:** Attempting to wire Hermes’ cockpit into Dear PyGui for a more ergonomic interface.

**Observed issues:**
1. **Import quirks**  
   - `import dearpygui.dearpygui as dpg` sometimes fails depending on environment.  
   - Needed to confirm correct install: `pip install dearpygui`.  

2. **Async vs. blocking loop**  
   - Hermes’ FastAPI server runs async.  
   - Dear PyGui’s `dpg.start_dearpygui()` is blocking.  
   - Attempted to run both in the same process → deadlock.  

3. **Workarounds tested**  
   - Running FastAPI in a **separate thread** while Dear PyGui owns the main loop.  
   - Tried `uvicorn.run(app, loop="asyncio")` inside a thread.  
   - Mixed results: sometimes GUI loads, sometimes server fails to respond.  

4. **Next steps**  
   - Explore **dual‑launcher script**: one process for GUI, one for server, orchestrated by a parent script.  
   - Consider **message‑passing bridge** (e.g., ZeroMQ or websockets) between GUI and server.  
   - Document exact failure modes for outsider onboarding.

## Mythic framing
Hermes is still in its *primordial chaos* phase — sparks flying, inconsistencies mutating. Our role is not to erase the chaos, but to build the crucible around it. Yesterday’s work was less about clean victories and more about mapping the edges of the storm.
