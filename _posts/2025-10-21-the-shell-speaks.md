[DeepSeek chat project][repo]
[repo]: https://github.com/bestevenyoung/hello-github/tree/main/apps/deepseekchat

I beheld, with the strange mixture of wonder and resolve that attends the first unnatural animation of a devised being, the simple apparatus I had assembled in a single day. It was not the monstrous enterprise of a life claimed from lightning, but a quieter conjuration: a Godot shell that speaks to an API, a modest engine that listens and stores a single key. The creature was at once proof and promise, a thought made manifest by keystrokes and commits.

### Work Completed Today

- **Initialized a Godot project** and committed the initial scaffold to the repository.  
- **Connected the app** to the DeepSeek API so the interface may speak upon receipt of a user-supplied key.  
- **Placed the project** within the `apps/deepseekchat` folder of the `hello-github` repository.  
- **Recorded the ritual** as a devlog entry declaring this work a proof of concept rather than a continuing labor.  
- **Created a cover image** that unites the maker and the made, now stored in the repository assets at the provided path.

### The Proof

This day’s labor was a demonstration rather than an evolution. Two propositions were to be tested and proven beyond rhetorical hope. First, that applications may be wrought in Godot with the ordinary tools of a maker whose workshop is a single laptop. Second, that such an application may bind itself to an external intelligence by the slender thread of an API key. Both propositions stand affirmed. The shell speaks. It requires a DeepSeek key to awaken. It does not promise itself further refinement. It is a token, a sign, an experiment closed upon success.

### The Image and Its Meaning

A cover image now marks the repository like a title page. It portrays the maker and his made as if sketched on a pulp magazine cover where myth and mechanism meet. The imagery is chosen to make manifest the experiment’s temperament: a deliberate assembly of parts named and visible. The file is available in the repository so any reader may open the page and see the moment when a small machine first answered a human summons.

### Closing Manifesto

Let this stand as a dated witness: a brief, decisive proof that Godot is a vessel and DeepSeek a voice. I set no course for expansion within this shard of work. Tomorrow a fresh design will begin with a different mandate. The next shell must not merely speak or listen. It must act. For now the experiment is complete and the log is sealed.
