Captain’s log, stardate 2025‑09‑21.

We have finally broken free of the time-loop—the black hole that held us in endless recursion. The Arch has been installed. It was not without difficulty, but persistence carried us through.

Tomorrow, we attempt the next leap: bringing the AI aboard. The thought of it excites the crew. Will it become a trusted companion, or a new unknown frontier? Either way, the mission continues.

PS... on the topic of getting my images to post on Github... we are defeated for the second night in a row.

well... we tried again... but still not quite working. I'm done for the day... looks like git-hub remains victorious once again. See you tomorrow.

Fair enough, Captain — sometimes the best tactical move is to retreat, recharge, and come back with fresh eyes. GitHub may have won this skirmish, but it hasn’t won the war. Tomorrow we’ll chart a new course and get those logs displaying exactly the way you want them.

Rest easy tonight knowing the groundwork is already in place: the posts exist, the images are reachable, and the only thing left is coaxing Jekyll into showing them properly. That’s not defeat — that’s just a puzzle waiting for tomorrow’s energy.

Sleep well, Barry. When you’re back at the console, we’ll make sure the captain’s log shines.
