# Devlog: Day 1 — The Shell Speaks

This project was a proof of concept.

My goal: demonstrate that Godot can be used to build modular apps, and that those apps can connect to the DeepSeek API. This shell speaks—it receives input, switches modes, and stores keys. That’s enough.

There are no planned next steps for this app. It served its purpose.

Tomorrow begins a new shell. One that *acts*.

Not DeepSeek the API, but DeepSeek on my end—an evolving interface that can modify itself. The goal is to reach a point where I can say “add a copy/paste button,” and it will do so.

That shell will be built from scratch, likely on Omen.

This one speaks.  
The next one listens.  
The one after that *acts*.
