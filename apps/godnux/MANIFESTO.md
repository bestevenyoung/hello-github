# Godnux Manifesto

## Purpose
Godnux exists to **democratize computing** by dissolving the boundary between “user” and “developer.”  
It is a kernel-first engine inspired by Linux and Godot, designed to empower anyone to compose, remix, and extend their environment through natural, expressive commands.

## Principles
1. **Transparency** — Every decision, from kernel design to module governance, is documented and auditable.  
2. **Pluralism** — No single authority owns Godnux. Forks, remixes, and divergent visions are welcome.  
3. **Stewardship** — Contributors are custodians, not gatekeepers. The project thrives on reversible, accountable governance.  
4. **Accessibility** — Non-programmers should be able to create and extend modules without needing deep technical expertise.  
5. **Resilience** — Systems are designed with fallback, integrity, and survival in mind. Mistakes are part of the journey.  

## Current Reality
Godnux is **experimental software**. The kernel runs, modules load, and the CLI provides management commands.  
But there are **known issues**: incomplete security enforcement, unstable scheduling, and evolving APIs.  
This is not production-ready. It is a **laboratory for ideas** and a **threshold for creators**.

## Vision
- To build a modular ecosystem where automation is accessible, transparent, and accountable.  
- To enable true autonomous computing: asking the AI to generate bespoke tools (spreadsheets, word processors, creative engines) on demand.  
- To ritualize computing as a creative act, where modules are not just code but **mythic artifacts** in a shared story.  

## Invitation
Godnux is for:
- **Tinkerers** who love experimental kernels.  
- **Educators** who want minimal systems to teach OS concepts.  
- **Researchers** exploring trust, security, and modular governance.  
- **Creators** who want to shape tools without waiting for corporations to deliver them.  

If you join, you do so with eyes open: Godnux is unstable, imperfect, and evolving.  
But it is also a **threshold guardian** — a place where new creators step across into autonomy.

**Summary:** Godnux is not a product. It is a **movement** toward pluralistic, remixable computing.  
Its kernel is the seed; its modules are the branches. The community is the forest.
