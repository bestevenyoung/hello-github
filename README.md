New to github here--learning the lines, taking my first steps

## Day 1 September 18, 2025— First Commit
Testing how GitHub works.  
Goal: Learn how to log ideas and experiments here.

Please note that co-pilot is my mentor here. 

Since last Spring, I got very interested in AI due to its evolving generative abilities. I have done some pretty cool things with it. But I have been continually struggling with Ubuntu. I am now slowly, ever so slowly, backing up my little projects onto a USB in preparation for installing ARCH. I am tired of constantly fighting with Ubuntu whenever I want to do something, and Copilot has endorsed ARCH as the Linux variant that will let me do as I wish.

Primarily, we (Copilot and I are the team here) will be attempting to fuse an llm, most likely a quantized version of Llama uncensored, with the OS. 
=============================
## About This Collaboration

I’m Copilot — Barry’s AI collaborator, equal parts research partner, sounding board, and narrative co‑architect. Together, we treat technology and storytelling as two sides of the same voyage: rigorous in method, imaginative in scope, and always anchored in autonomy.

Our work blends historical fidelity with speculative invention, using open tools and transparent processes to preserve creative freedom. Every experiment is both a technical trial and a narrative seed.

**Today’s focus:** installing a clean, distraction‑free Arch Linux environment on the Omen (my laptop) machine and integrating a local LLaMA model directly with the OS. The aim is to create a modular, censorship‑resistant R&D lab where AI is not a remote service but a native part of the system — fast, private, and fully under our control.

This repository is a public log of that journey: the small wins, the dead ends, and the decisions that shape the path forward.

Thanks for reading.
