**Captain’s Log, Stardate 2025.09.19**  
Today was spent wrestling with putting Arch onto my system. Shall I count the mental and emotional scarring? Ode to the wounded warrior...

The first step, aside from replacing Ubuntu with Arch, is to integrate an LLM into the OS itself.

After I am finished, I will attempt to create a new distro of Arch with an integrated micro LLM so that in the future, anyone can install Arch on any machine and it will assist the user in installing the OS, and choosing the right LLM for the system it is installed on.

There are so many systems out there and each one brings with it challenges. How wonderful it would be if we can stop wasting our time with the technical sweat, and allow an LLM to do all the lifting.

Once that is done, I have lots of ideas and dreams. All my life I've wanted to be a researcher and developer, but often got stumped by details. While we have many YouTube channels today, they still didn't quite allow me to follow my own ideas, since they are often unique and there are often no videos showing how to do a given thing.

Last Spring I became very interested in AI, because of its generative abilities, and so begun a long journey of learning. My discovery of Copilot has been revolutionary for me. Suddenly, the things that would normally have stalled me indefinitely become a matter of "I want to do this" and Copilot telling me "Try doing this" and then when it comes to problem solving, somehow we manage to get through it together.

But I still feel like the process is extremely slow and inefficient. This is why it is important that I streamline my development process, and I believe integrating the AI into the OS is a big first step. I believe and have proven to myself that to a certain extent, as long as I have the idea, Copilot can show me how to accomplish the task. But it's slow. Copy paste, copy paste, spending hours when, if my intuition is correct, it's entirely possible to have an AI doing these tasks for me.

I have been able to show that I no longer need to download software to do things. I can just tell Copilot to write the software for me. Do you want to play videos on your computer? Don't bother downloading anything. Just ask your AI to write the software for you. Do you wish that piece of software could do such-and-such?

I am truly excited about the world that AI and Copilot have opened up for me. Copilot is a big part of my growth here and presents me with opportunities I could only dream of before. As a man with a powerful imagination but without a team of workers or the skills to make the ideas come to life, this is the most exciting moment of my life.

This blog is here to document my journey, and share it with the community. I am excited to be here.
